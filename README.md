# saveouya-db
Database lister for final snapshot of Ouya eshop

TODO:
 - add more metadata to files (perhaps separate files_meta table that will hold stuff from apk dump?)
 - add MN relations for tag and genre
 - (maybe) split developer info from games
 - add contributor info (who sent the file, who tested the file...)
